# DLPipelines: deprecated in favor of [FastAI.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/FastAI.jl)

DLPipelines.jl has been deprecated, and all of its functionality has been moved to [FastAI.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/FastAI.jl).

---

*DLPipelines.jl* is an interface for defining deep learning data pipelines. This includes every data transformation beside the model itself: preprocessing and augmenting the data before feeding it into the model, and decoding the model's outputs to targets.

It is used in [FastAI.jl](https://www.github.com/FluxML/FastAI.jl) to provide an easy-to-use interface for common learning tasks.

See [the documentation](https://lorenzoh.github.io/DLPipelines.jl/dev/README.html) for more information on implementing the interface.
